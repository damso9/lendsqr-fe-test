## Overview

This project showcases the frontend skills required for a high-quality, production-ready web application. It focuses on delivering an exact visual fidelity to the Figma design, robust code structure, responsive layout, and clean documentation.

## Features

- Pixel-perfect representation of the design
- Fully responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Error handling and form validation
- Positive and negative scenario testing
- GitHub documentation for smooth code review

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies, each selected for its specific strengths to achieve the requirements:

### 1. **React** - Core UI Library
   - Used to build the user interface in a component-based architecture, enabling reusable, testable, and maintainable code.

### 2. **TypeScript** - Static Typing
   - Ensures type safety and reduces potential runtime errors, making the codebase more reliable and easier to debug.

### 3. **Material-UI (MUI) ICONS** - Component Library
   - Provides very robust Icon component with a Robust ecosystem to support it.
   
### 4. **Formik & Yup** - Form Handling and Validation
   - Formik manages form state and submission, while Yup provides schema-based form validation. Together, they offer a smooth experience for handling complex form inputs and validation rules.

### 5. **React Router** - Client-Side Routing
   - Manages page navigation without full page reloads, ensuring a smooth and responsive single-page application experience.

### 6. **Jest & React Testing Library** - Unit Testing
   - Ensures reliable, bug-free code by testing components for positive and negative scenarios, focusing on component behavior and user interactions.

### 8. **Sass** - Preprocessor for CSS
   - Provides advanced styling capabilities, including nested styles and variables, for scalable and maintainable stylesheets that adhere to best practices in design.
